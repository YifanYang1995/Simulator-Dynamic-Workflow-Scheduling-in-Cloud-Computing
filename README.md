# Simulator-Dynamic-Workflow-Scheduling-in-Cloud-Computing
Dynamic workflow scheduling (DWS) plays a crucial role in cloud computing. This simulator aims to make intelligent decisions in terms of workflow allocation and VM provisioning by **VM selection rules (VMSRs)**. The objective is to minimize the total costs associated with VM rental fees and deadline violation penalties.
